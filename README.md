ComfyUI custom node to support 3D GS rendering

This repository provides a ComfyUI custom node that integrates with [Forge](https://github.com/forge-gfx/forge), an advanced 3D Gaussian Splatting renderer for THREE.js. By installing this custom node, creators can easily interact with and render their splat files (such as .PLY, .SPZ, .SPLAT, .KSPLAT) directly within ComfyUI, leveraging Forge's real-time, high-performance 3D GS rendering capabilities.

### Bundling

Run `npm run build` to generate `dist/main.js` file from `src`.
